# FreeAGirlBusiness
The business version of the old Free a Girl design, developed while I worked at JWT Amsterdam.

The site was to be sent as a html page to businesses to promote the campaign and secure sponsorships. The site is simplistic, incorporating elements of the original website design, simplified to promote the key information.
